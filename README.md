## What's in this repo?

This repo contains the scripts, inside the [R](https://github.com/ONSvisual/subnational-indicators/tree/main/R) folder, which are used to process an input file created by the subnational team at ONS. We use this input file to produce the machine readable data download and the file that powers the visualisation. 

The repo also contains the code for the visualisation itself inside the [app](https://github.com/ONSvisual/subnational-indicators/tree/main/app) folder. The [lib](https://github.com/ONSvisual/subnational-indicators/tree/main/lib) folder contains common libraries used in our visualisation.
