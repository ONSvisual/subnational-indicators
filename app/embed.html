Welsh energy efficiency affected by high proportion of older homes
In England, 42% of assessed homes were rated EPC C or higher, while in Wales, the figure was 37%. The difference between countries can be partially explained by the higher proportion of older homes in Wales, which are less likely to have a high energy efficiency rating.

There is some variation between English regions, with London having the highest proportion of oldest homes, and the South West having the highest proportion of newest homes. In Wales, 39% of homes were built between 1930 and 1982, and 5% were built in 2012 or later. Of all areas, Wales has the highest proportion of homes built before 1900, at 23%.

Eight of the ten areas with the most energy efficient homes are in London
Many areas with the highest proportion of energy efficient homes are in cities, while most areas with the lowest proportion of efficient homes are in more rural areas. Of the 10 local authority areas with the highest proportion of efficient homes, eight are in London. Tower Hamlets has the highest proportion of homes rated C or higher, at 75%, followed by Newham, Hackney, Southwark and the City of London.
